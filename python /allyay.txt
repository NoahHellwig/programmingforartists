2. Oblivion XP. This basically make you level like a traditional RPG with skill points to a lot. It's really really good. Seriously. It's impossible to go back to the crappy system Oblivion originally used after using this.

Great mod that makes a huge impact on realism. Everything just looks and feels more real. 

Otherwise go with the normal favourites... MMM / Warcry / Deadly Reflex etc. I tend to look at whatever is top on tesnexus.

Something I have noticed: You can add LOADS of extra animations, for NPCs, yourself, hand to hand combat, different jumps, DMC stylish etc - and by using OBMM and activating them in different orders you can have a lot of animations active which gives a real sense of diversity. More realistic in my opinion. I have a vampire that uses three different jump animations, one for wielding one hand weapons, one for two hand, and a sky dive for unarmed jumps. Keeps things fresh. 


If you know what you're doing, [TCOM](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AYTrAQ8yzT__ZHpwNHc0ZF84ZDgzOHR2Zm0&hl=en) will pretty much cover that  "as pimped out and awesome as (you) can" requirement. And then some.
The uninstall button.

The game is great and all that, but god it is hard to fully remove all the junk it leaves behind on your system. 
You really need to check out that mod when the time comes to get rid of it.

Otherwise, I think Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul is a nice start.
Search.  This questions has been asked way too often.
Wat?
Next he'll be asking what good pc games will run on his old laptop.
The uninstall button...The game is great, Ubisoft goes Steamworks bye bye, always on DRM. But you oft go work, always on work DR. Check out the junk it leaves behind in you.
This makes even less sense. Oblivion has an uninstall button. It works. I have used more times than I care to mention. All mods install themselves in oblivions directory. The un-install doesn't touch them as it is unaware. All you do is delete the 'oblivion' directory. 

Then they gone bye byes jes?

2. Oblivion XP. This basically make you level like a traditional RPG with skill points to a lot. It's really really good. Seriously. It's impossible to go back to the crappy system Oblivion originally used after using this.

Bonus: Race rebalancing project. Makes the races a much more unique, helps magic users out a bit (works great with OOO and L.A.M.E). Also, Darnified UI is very nice.

Great mod that makes a huge impact on realism. Everything just looks and feels more real. 

Otherwise go with the normal favourites... MMM / Warcry / Deadly Reflex etc. I tend to look at whatever is top on tesnexus.

Something I have noticed: You can add LOADS of extra animations, for NPCs, yourself, hand to hand combat, different jumps, DMC stylish etc - and by using OBMM and activating them in different orders you can have a lot of animations active which gives a real sense of diversity. More realistic in my opinion. I have a vampire that uses three different jump animations, one for wielding one hand weapons, one for two hand, and a sky dive for unarmed jumps. Keeps things fresh.

http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/07/16/ten-essential-oblivion-mods/
Here's two mods that I simply can't live without: 

1. Obscuro's Oblivion Overhaul. It's simply amazing, it make it to where the monsters in the world don't scale with your level, making it a much more immersive experience.

2. Oblivion XP. This basically make you level like a traditional RPG with skill points to a lot. It's really really good. Seriously. It's impossible to go back to the crappy system Oblivion originally used after using this.

Bonus: Race rebalancing project. Makes the races a much more unique, helps magic users out a bit (works great with OOO and L.A.M.E). Also, Darnified UI is very nice.
[All natural](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=18305)

Great mod that makes a huge impact on realism. Everything just looks and feels more real. 

Otherwise go with the normal favourites... MMM / Warcry / Deadly Reflex etc. I tend to look at whatever is top on tesnexus.

Something I have noticed: You can add LOADS of extra animations, for NPCs, yourself, hand to hand combat, different jumps, DMC stylish etc - and by using OBMM and activating them in different orders you can have a lot of animations active which gives a real sense of diversity. More realistic in my opinion. I have a vampire that uses three different jump animations, one for wielding one hand weapons, one for two hand, and a sky dive for unarmed jumps. Keeps things fresh. 


If you know what you're doing, [TCOM](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AYTrAQ8yzT__ZHpwNHc0ZF84ZDgzOHR2Zm0&hl=en) will pretty much cover that  "as pimped out and awesome as (you) can" requirement. And then some.
The uninstall button.

The game is great and all that, but god it is hard to fully remove all the junk it leaves behind on your system. 
You really need to check out that mod when the time comes to get rid of it.

Otherwise, I think Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul is a nice start.
Search.  This questions has been asked way too often.
Wat?
Next he'll be asking what good pc games will run on his old laptop.
The uninstall button...The game is great, Ubisoft goes Steamworks bye bye, always on DRM. But you oft go work, always on work DR. Check out the junk it leaves behind in you.
This makes even less sense. Oblivion has an uninstall button. It works. I have used more times than I care to mention. All mods install themselves in oblivions directory. The un-install doesn't touch them as it is unaware. All you do is delete the 'oblivion' directory. 

Then they gone bye byes jes?

Here's two mods that I simply can't live without: 

1. Obscuro's Oblivion Overhaul. It's simply amazing, it make it to where the monsters in the world don't scale with your level, making it a much more immersive experience.

2. Oblivion XP. This basically make you level like a traditional RPG with skill points to a lot. It's really really good. Seriously. It's impossible to go back to the crappy system Oblivion originally used after using this.

Bonus: Race rebalancing project. Makes the races a much more unique, helps magic users out a bit (works great with OOO and L.A.M.E). Also, Darnified UI is very nice.

Great mod that makes a huge impact on realism. Everything just looks and feels more real. 

Otherwise go with the normal favourites... MMM / Warcry / Deadly Reflex etc. I tend to look at whatever is top on tesnexus.

Something I have noticed: You can add LOADS of extra animations, for NPCs, yourself, hand to hand combat, different jumps, DMC stylish etc - and by using OBMM and activating them in different orders you can have a lot of animations active which gives a real sense of diversity. More realistic in my opinion. I have a vampire that uses three different jump animations, one for wielding one hand weapons, one for two hand, and a sky dive for unarmed jumps. Keeps things fresh. 


If you know what you're doing, [TCOM](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AYTrAQ8yzT__ZHpwNHc0ZF84ZDgzOHR2Zm0&hl=en) will pretty much cover that  "as pimped out and awesome as (you) can" requirement. And then some.
The uninstall button.

The game is great and all that, but god it is hard to fully remove all the junk it leaves behind on your system. 
You really need to check out that mod when the time comes to get rid of it.

Otherwise, I think Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul is a nice start.
Search.  This questions has been asked way too often.
Wat?
Next he'll be asking what good pc games will run on his old laptop.
The uninstall button...The game is great, Ubisoft goes Steamworks bye bye, always on DRM. But you oft go work, always on work DR. Check out the junk it leaves behind in you.
This makes even less sense. Oblivion has an uninstall button. It works. I have used more times than I care to mention. All mods install themselves in oblivions directory. The un-install doesn't touch them as it is unaware. All you do is delete the 'oblivion' directory. 

Then they gone bye byes jes?

http://www.pcgamer.com/2010/07/16/ten-essential-oblivion-mods/
Here's two mods that I simply can't live without: 

1. Obscuro's Oblivion Overhaul. It's simply amazing, it make it to where the monsters in the world don't scale with your level, making it a much more immersive experience.

2. Oblivion XP. This basically make you level like a traditional RPG with skill points to a lot. It's really really good. Seriously. It's impossible to go back to the crappy system Oblivion originally used after using this.

Bonus: Race rebalancing project. Makes the races a much more unique, helps magic users out a bit (works great with OOO and L.A.M.E). Also, Darnified UI is very nice.
[All natural](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=18305)

Great mod that makes a huge impact on realism. Everything just looks and feels more real. 

Otherwise go with the normal favourites... MMM / Warcry / Deadly Reflex etc. I tend to look at whatever is top on tesnexus.

Something I have noticed: You can add LOADS of extra animations, for NPCs, yourself, hand to hand combat, different jumps, DMC stylish etc - and by using OBMM and activating them in different orders you can have a lot of animations active which gives a real sense of diversity. More realistic in my opinion. I have a vampire that uses three different jump animations, one for wielding one hand weapons, one for two hand, and a sky dive for unarmed jumps. Keeps things fresh. 


If you know what you're doing, [TCOM](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AYTrAQ8yzT__ZHpwNHc0ZF84ZDgzOHR2Zm0&hl=en) will pretty much cover that  "as pimped out and awesome as (you) can" requirement. And then some.
The uninstall button.

The game is great and all that, but god it is hard to fully remove all the junk it leaves behind on your system. 
You really need to check out that mod when the time comes to get rid of it.

Otherwise, I think Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul is a nice start.
Search.  This questions has been asked way too often.
Wat?
Next he'll be asking what good pc games will run on his old laptop.
The uninstall button...The game is great, Ubisoft goes Steamworks bye bye, always on DRM. But you oft go work, always on work DR. Check out the junk it leaves behind in you.
This makes even less sense. Oblivion has an uninstall button. It works. I have used more times than I care to mention. All mods install themselves in oblivions directory. The un-install doesn't touch them as it is unaware. All you do is delete the 'oblivion' directory. 

Then they gone bye byes jes?

Here's two mods that I simply can't live without: 

1. Obscuro's Oblivion Overhaul. It's simply amazing, it make it to where the monsters in the world don't scale with your level, making it a much more immersive experience.

2. Oblivion XP. This basically make you level like a traditional RPG with skill points to a lot. It's really really good. Seriously. It's impossible to go back to the crappy system Oblivion originally used after using this.

Bonus: Race rebalancing project. Makes the races a much more unique, helps magic users out a bit (works great with OOO and L.A.M.E). Also, Darnified UI is very nice.
[All natural](http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=18305)

Great mod that makes a huge impact on realism. Everything just looks and feels more real. 

Otherwise go with the normal favourites... MMM / Warcry / Deadly Reflex etc. I tend to look at whatever is top on tesnexus.

Something I have noticed: You can add LOADS of extra animations, for NPCs, yourself, hand to hand combat, different jumps, DMC stylish etc - and by using OBMM and activating them in different orders you can have a lot of animations active which gives a real sense of diversity. More realistic in my opinion. I have a vampire that uses three different jump animations, one for wielding one hand weapons, one for two hand, and a sky dive for unarmed jumps. Keeps things fresh. 


If you know what you're doing, [TCOM](https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AYTrAQ8yzT__ZHpwNHc0ZF84ZDgzOHR2Zm0&hl=en) will pretty much cover that  "as pimped out and awesome as (you) can" requirement. And then some.
The uninstall button.

The game is great and all that, but god it is hard to fully remove all the junk it leaves behind on your system. 
You really need to check out that mod when the time comes to get rid of it.

Otherwise, I think Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul is a nice start.
Search.  This questions has been asked way too often.
Wat?
Next he'll be asking what good pc games will run on his old laptop.
The uninstall button...The game is great, Ubisoft goes Steamworks bye bye, always on DRM. But you oft go work, always on work DR. Check out the junk it leaves behind in you.
This makes even less sense. Oblivion has an uninstall button. It works. I have used more times than I care to mention. All mods install themselves in oblivions directory. The un-install doesn't touch them as it is unaware. All you do is delete the 'oblivion' directory. 

Then they gone bye byes jes?
US teamworks bye bye, always on DRM.
